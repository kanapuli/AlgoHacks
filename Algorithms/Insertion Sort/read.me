A Input Array will be given  inputArray = [a1 ,a2,a3,a4,a5 ...]
Permutations must be done in this array and the output will  be like [a1',a2',a3',a4',a5'..] such that 
a1'<=a2'<=a3'...

Permutation is nothing but rearranging the numbers in certain order . Insertion sort is to be used 

PsuedoCode:
input array length n 
for j => 2 .. n
    k = j
    while k = 0
        if arr[j] < arr [j-1]
            shift arr[j-1] = arr[j]
            k--
    k = j+ 1
    Run the loop
